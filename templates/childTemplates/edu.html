<div>I am a distinguished graduate of DeVry University, where I secured an Associate's Degree in Information Technology and Networking. My dedication to academia earned me a spot on the Dean's List. Now, I'm ardently working towards my Bachelor's Degree in Software Design and Programming, constantly broadening my horizons. I've set my sights on Colorado Technical University â€” not just for a Master's in Computer Science, but also for their esteemed Doctoral program in Big Data. With an unwavering passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I am poised to channel my education into pioneering strides in the AI/ML field.</div>
